### Q: What is Event Bubble and Event Delegation in JS?

#### Event Bubbling:
Event Bubbling is a process in which an event starts from the target element and then bubbles up to its parent elements in the DOM hierarchy. This means that if an event is triggered on an element, it will first run the event handler on that element, and then on its parent element, and so on, until it reaches the root of the document.

#### Event Delegation
Event Delegation is a technique that leverages event bubbling to handle events at a higher level in the DOM, rather than attaching event listeners to each individual element. This is especially useful when you have many elements and you want to manage events efficiently.

### Q: What is the difference between localstorage , session storage and cookies?

A: The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.


### Q: In CSS what is the difference between display inline , display inline block and display block?

A: with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
